#include "bee.h"
according to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly
its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground
the bee of course flies anyway because bees dont care what humans think is impossible
yellow black yellow black yellow black yellow black
ooh black and_ yellow
lets shake it up a little
barry breakfast is ready

you did come back different
hi barry artie growing a mustache looks good
hear about frankie
yeah

no im not_ going
everybody knows sting someone you die
dont waste it on a squirrel
such a hothead
i guess he could have just gotten out of the way
i love this incorporating an amusement park into our day
thats why we dont need vacations
boy quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances
well adam today we are men
we are
bee men
amen
hallelujah
students faculty distinguished bees
please welcome dean buzzwell
welcome new hive city graduating class of nine fifteen
that concludes our ceremonies and_ begins your career at honex industries
will we pick our job today
i heard its just orientation
heads up here we go
keep your hands and_ antennas inside the tram at all times
wonder what itll be like
a little scary
welcome to honex a division of honesco and_ a part of the hexagon group
this is it
wow
wow
we know that you as a bee have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life
honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive
our top secret formula is automatically color corrected scent adjusted and_ bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as honey
that girl was hot
shes my cousin
she is
yes were all cousins
right youre right
at honex we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence
these bees are stress testing a new helmet technology
what do you think he makes
not_ enough
here we have our latest advancement the krelman
what does that do
catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it
saves us millions
can anyone work on the krelman
of course most bee jobs are small ones
but bees know that every small job if its done well means a lot
but choose carefully because youll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life
the same job the rest of your life i didnt know that
whats the difference
youll be happy to know that bees as a species havent had one day off in twenty seven million years
so youll just work us to death
well sure try
wow that blew my mind
whats the difference
how can you say that
one job forever
thats an insane choice to have to make
im relieved now we only have to make one decision in life
but adam how could they never have told us that
why would you question anything were bees
were the most perfectly functioning society on earth
you ever think maybe things work a little too well here
like what give me one example
i dont know but you know what im talking about
please clear the gate royal nectar force on approach
wait a second check it out
hey those are pollen jocks
wow
ive never seen them this close
they know what its like outside the hive

hey jocks
hi jocks
you guys did great
youre monsters
youre sky freaks i love it i love it
i wonder where they were
i dont know
their days not_ planned
outside the hive flying who knows where doing who knows what
you cant just decide to be a pollen jock you have to be bred for that
right
look thats more pollen than you and_ i will see in a lifetime
its just a status symbol
bees make too much of it
perhaps unless youre wearing it and_ the ladies see you wearing it
those ladies
arent they our cousins too
distant distant
look at these two
couple of hive harrys
lets have fun with them
it must be dangerous being a pollen jock
yeah once a bear pinned me against a mushroom
he had a paw on my throat and_ with the other he was slapping me

maybe this could make up for it a little bit
this lawsuits a pretty big deal
i guess
you sure you want to go through with it
am i sure when im done with the humans they wont be able to say honey im home without paying a royalty
its an incredible scene here in downtown manhattan where the world anxiously waits because for the first time in history we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak
what have we gotten into here barry
its pretty big isnt it
i cant believe how many humans dont work during the day
you think billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers
everybody needs to stay behind the barricade
whats the matter
i dont know i just got a chill
well if it isnt the bee team
you boys work on this
all rise the honorable judge bumbleton presiding
all right case number four thousand four hundred seventy five
superior court of new york
barry bee benson v the honey industry is now in session
mr montgomery youre representing the five food companies collectively
a privilege
mr benson youre representing all the bees of the world
im kidding yes your honor were ready to proceed
mr montgomery your opening statement please
ladies and_ gentlemen of the jury my grandmother was a simple woman born on a farm she believed it was mans divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature god put before us
if we lived in the topsy turvy world mr benson imagines just think of what would it mean
i would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches
talking bee
how do we know this isnt some sort of holographic motion picture capture hollywood wizardry
they could be using laser beams robotics ventriloquism cloning for all we know he could be on steroids
mr benson
ladies and_ gentlemen theres no trickery here im just an ordinary bee honeys pretty important to me its important to all bees we invented it we make it and_ we protect it with our lives
unfortunately there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us cause were the little guys
im hoping that after this is all over youll see how by taking our honey you not_ only take everything we have but everything we are
i wish hed dress like that all the time so nice
call your first witness
so mr klauss vanderhayden of honey farms big company you have
i suppose so
i see you also own honeyburton and_ honron
yes they provide beekeepers for our farms
beekeeper i find that to be a very disturbing term
i dont imagine you employ any bee free ers do you
no
i couldnt hear you
no
no because you dont free bees you keep bees not_ only that it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey
theyre very lovable creatures yogi bear fozzie bear build a bear
you mean like this
bears kill bees
howd you like his head crashing through your living room biting into your couch spitting out your throw pillows ok thats enough take him away
so mr sting thank you for being here your name intrigues me where have i heard it before
i was with a band called the police
but youve never been a police officer have you
no i havent
no you havent and_ so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance about stage name
oh please
have you ever been stung mr sting because im feeling a little stung sting or_ should i say mr gordon m sumner
thats not_ his real name you idiots
mr liotta first belated congratulations on your emmy win for a guest spot on er in two thousand and_ five
thank you thank you
i see from your resume that youre devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil thats ready to blow
i enjoy what i do is that a crime
not_ yet it isnt but is this what its come to for you exploiting tiny helpless bees so you dont have to rehearse your part and_ learn your lines sir
watch it benson i could blow right now
this isnt a goodfella
this is a badfella
why doesnt someone just step on this creep and_ we can all go home
order in this court
youre all thinking it
order order i say

mr liotta please sit down
i think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that i think the jurys on our side

im a florist
right well heres to a great team
to a great team
well hello
ken

thats where i usually sit right there
ken barry was looking at your resume and_ he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isnt really a special skill
you think i dont see what youre doing
i know how hard it is to find the right job we have that in common

bees have one hundred percent employment but we do jobs like taking the crud out
thats just what i was thinking about doing
ken i let barry borrow your razor for his fuzz i hope that was all right
im going to drain the old stinger

long time what are you talking about are there other bugs in your life
 no but there are other things bugging me in life and_ youre one of them
fine talking bees no yogurt night
my nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster
goodbye ken
and_ for your information i prefer sugar free artificial sweeteners made by man
im sorry about all that
i know its got an aftertaste i like it
i always felt there was some kind of barrier between ken and_ me i couldnt overcome it
oh well
are you ok for the trial
i believe mr montgomery is about out of ideas
we would like to call mr barry benson bee to the stand
good idea you can really see why hes considered one of the best lawyers
yeah
layton youve gotta weave some magic with this jury or_ its gonna be all over
dont worry the only thing i have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they dont like about bees
you got the tweezers
are you allergic
only to losing son only to losing
mr benson bee ill ask you what i think wed all like to know
what exactly is your relationship to that woman
were friends
good friends
yes
how good do you live together
wait a minute are you her little bedbug
ive seen a bee documentary or_ two from what i understand doesnt your queen give birth to all the bee children
yeah but
so those arent your real parents
oh barry
yes they are
hold me back
youre an illegitimate bee arent you benson
hes denouncing bees
dont yall date your cousins
objection
im going to pincushion this guy
adam dont its what he wants
oh im hit oh lordy i am hit
order order
the venom the venom is coursing through my veins i have been felled by a winged beast of destruction you see you cant treat them like equals theyre striped savages stingings the only thing they know its their way
adam stay with me
i cant feel my legs
what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks
i will have order in this court order order please
the case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung layton t montgomery
hey buddy
hey
is there much pain
yeah
i i blew the whole case didnt i
it doesnt matter what matters is
youre alive you could have died
id be better off dead look at me
they got it from the cafeteria downstairs in a tuna sandwich look theres a little celery still on it
what was it like to sting someone
i cant explain it it was all all adrenaline and_ thenand then ecstasy
all right
you think it was all a trap
of course im sorry i flew us right into this
what were we thinking look at us were just a couple of bugs in this world
what will the humans do to us if they win
i dont know
i hear they put the roaches in motels that doesnt sound so bad
adam they check in but they dont check out
oh my
could you get a nurse to close that window
why
the smoke
bees dont smoke
right bees dont smoke
bees dont smoke
but some bees are smoking
thats it thats our case
it is its not_ over
get dressed ive gotta go somewhere
get back to the court and_ stall stall any way you can
and_ assuming youve done step correctly youre ready for the tub
mr flayman
yes yes your honor
where is the rest of your team
well your honor its interesting bees are trained to fly haphazardly and_ as a result we dont make very good time
i actually heard a funny story about
your honor havent these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this courts valuable time how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on
they have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who run legitimate businesses
i move for a complete dismissal of this entire case
mr flayman im afraid im going to have to consider mr montgomerys motion
but you cant we have a terrific case
where is your proof
where is the evidence
show me the smoking gun
hold it your honor
you want a smoking gun here is your smoking gun
what is that
its a bee smoker
what this this harmless little contraption this couldnt hurt a fly let alone a bee
look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked smoking or_ non is this what nature intended for us to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and_ man made wooden slat work camps
living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man
what are we gonna do
hes playing the species card
ladies and_ gentlemen please free these bees
free the bees free the bees free the bees free the bees free the bees
the court finds in favor of the bees
vanessa we won
i knew you could do it high five
sorry
im ok you know what this means
all the honey will finally belong to the bees
now we wont have to work so hard all the time
this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature benson
youll regret this
barry how much honey is out there
all right one at a time
barry who are you wearing
my sweater is ralph lauren and_ i have no pants
what if montgomerys right
what do you mean
weve been living the bee way a long time twenty seven million years
congratulations on your victory what will you demand as a settlement
first well demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps
then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with every last drop
we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly bad breath stink machine
were all aware of what they do in the woods
wait for my signal take him out
hell have nauseous for a few hours then hell be fine
and_ we will no longer tolerate bee negative nicknames
but its just a prance about stage name
unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and_ la dee da human tea time snack garnishments
cant breathe
bring it in boys
hold it right there good
tap it
mr buzzwell we just passed three cups and_ theres gallons more coming
i think we need to shut down
shut down weve never shut down
shut down honey production
stop making honey
turn your key sir
what do we do now
cannonball
were shutting honey production
mission abort
aborting pollination and_ nectar detail
returning to base
adam you wouldnt believe how much honey was out there
oh yeah
whats going on where is everybody
are they out celebrating
theyre home
they dont know what to do laying out sleeping in
i heard your uncle carl was on his way to san antonio with a cricket
at least we got our honey back
sometimes i think so what if humans liked our honey who wouldnt
its the greatest thing in the world i was excited to be part of making it
this was my new desk this was my new job i wanted to do it really well and_ now
now i cant
i dont understand why theyre not_ happy
i thought their lives would be better
theyre doing nothing its amazing
honey really changes people
you dont have any idea whats going on do you
what did you want to show me
this
what happened here
that is not_ the half of it
oh no oh my
theyre all wilting
doesnt look very good does it
no
and_ whose fault do you think that is
you know im gonna guess bees
bees
specifically me
i didnt think bees not_ needing to make honey would affect all these things
its not_ just flowers fruits vegetables they all need bees
thats our whole sat test right there
take away produce that affects the entire animal kingdom
and_ then of course
the human species
so if theres no more pollination it could all just go south here couldnt it
i know this is also partly my fault
how about a suicide pact
how do we do it
ill sting you you step on me
that just kills you twice
right right
listen barry sorry but i gotta get going
i had to open my mouth and_ talk
vanessa
vanessa why are you leaving
where are you going

i thought maybe you were remodeling
but i have another idea and_ its greater than my previous ideas combined
i dont want to hear it
all right they have the roses the roses have the pollen
i know every bee plant and_ flower bud in this park
all we gotta do is get what theyve got back here with what weve got
bees

once at the airport theres no stopping us
stop security
you and_ your insect pack your float
yes
has it been in your possession the entire time
would you remove your shoes
remove your stinger
its part of me

flowers
we have a storm in the area and_ two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience
just a minute theres a bee on that plane
im quite familiar with mr benson and_ his no account compadres
theyve done enough damage

technically a bee shouldnt be able to fly at all
their wings are too small havent we heard this a million times
the surface area of the wings and_ body mass make no sense
get this on the air
got it
stand by
were going live
the way we work may be a mystery to you making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs
but let me tell you about a small job if you do it well it makes a big difference
